Cave Story Randomizer
=====================

Todo
----

- Update to Love 11.2
- Remove Love files... lovec.exe, readme, etc.
- Trade Sequence Step B: Require random obtainable weapon, instead of always polar star and fireball.
- Randomize Booster v0.8 / v2.0

Issues
------

- [Speedrun] Random Mimiga in top left of Plantation seemingly gave +3? Probably a substition error with Life Capsule. https://youtu.be/PYhd9zhFdAk?t=5280
- [Speedrun] Snake in sisters fight https://youtu.be/PYhd9zhFdAk?t=4769
- [Speedrun] Best Ending events: Timer room and Curly's bed in plantation.
- Collecting the Super Missile Launcher increases your maximum missiles by 5. This does not normally happen.
- 3 Life Capsules can not be replaced because they appear on maps with 2 capsules. Need label-aware replace.
- Hell Missile Upgrade uses a unique script and won't be easy to replace.
- Trading back the Nemesis for the Blade almost certainly will be weird.
- Ikachan Medal aquisition happens in black screen, so it doesn't make sense to show text box as it makes the player have to mash through blackness.

Bugs
----
- Sleeping with Chaco seemed to do nothing
- Jellyfish juice box told me I got a life capsule, then it said "Max HP increased by 5! Max HP increased by 3!" and then gave me the juice and my HP was actually the same. It's doing this every time I get the juice.
- Jenka gave me a life pot, but since I already had one, nothing happened. It even stayed in the same spot, instead of moving to the front.
- King died to give me a health capsule. The boss music resumed after I took it.
- btw, teleporter room key also caused the music glitch.
