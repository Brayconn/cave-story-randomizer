Cave Story Randomizer
=====================

Todo
----

- Randomize the super missiles upgrade.
- Specifically replace first chest in Pole.tsc so that you always get a weapon.
- Provide modified Cave.pxm. (When Bubbline or Fireball)
- Trade Sequence Step A: Only weapons are acquired through trades.
- Print Warning/Error Count
- Supress Hell Music Error
- Trade Sequence Step B: Require random obtainable weapon, instead of always polar star and fireball.
- Randomize Booster v0.8 / v2.0

Issues
------

- 3 Life Capsules can not be replaced because they appear on maps with 2 capsules. Need label-aware replace.
- Hell Missile Upgrade uses a unique script and won't be easy to replace.
- Trading back the Nemesis for the Blade almost certainly will be weird.
