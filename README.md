Cave Story Randomizer
=====================

Todo
----

- Print Warning/Error Count
- Supress Hell Music Error
- Write log
- Support Cave Story+
- Missiles should only replace items which are not part of cutscenes.
- Trade Sequence Step B: Require random obtainable weapon, instead of always polar star and fireball.
- Randomize Booster v0.8 / v2.0

Issues
------

- Items will no longer trigger associated cutscenes if replaced with missiles. This probably breaks something somewhere...
- Collecting the Super Missile Launcher increases your maximum missiles by 5. This does not normally happen.
- 3 Life Capsules can not be replaced because they appear on maps with 2 capsules. Need label-aware replace.
- Hell Missile Upgrade uses a unique script and won't be easy to replace.
- Trading back the Nemesis for the Blade almost certainly will be weird.
