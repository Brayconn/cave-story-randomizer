Cave Story Randomizer
=====================

Todo
----

- Update to Love 11.2
- Remove Love files... lovec.exe, readme, etc.
- Trade Sequence Step B: Require random obtainable weapon, instead of always polar star and fireball.
- Randomize Booster v0.8 / v2.0

Issues
------

- Collecting the Super Missile Launcher increases your maximum missiles by 5. This does not normally happen.
- 3 Life Capsules can not be replaced because they appear on maps with 2 capsules. Need label-aware replace.
- Hell Missile Upgrade uses a unique script and won't be easy to replace.
- Trading back the Nemesis for the Blade almost certainly will be weird.

Bugs
----
- Broken Egg Observation Room (Log/Included)
- Sleeping with Chaco seemed to do nothing
- Jellyfish juice box told me I got a life capsule, then it said "Max HP increased by 5! Max HP increased by 3!" and then gave me the juice and my HP was actually the same. It's doing this every time I get the juice.
